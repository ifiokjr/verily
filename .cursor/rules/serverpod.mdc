### Auth

When accessing auth use this to get the userId.

```dart
final authenticationInfo = await session.authenticated;
final userId = authenticationInfo?.userId;
```

The following IS **BROKEN** and should not be used. 

```dart
/// ⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️ BROKEN DON'T USE THIS
int userId = session.auth.authenticatedUserId!;
```

See https://docs.serverpod.dev/concepts/authentication/basics for more information on authentication from the backend. 


### Generating code

If a failure happens after running `serverpod generate` and this is part of the error `invalid Dart syntax. Please review and correct the syntax errors.` the reason is that you've introduced a bug in the code. It has **NOTHING** to do with versions of project setup. Please fix the bug you've introduced first.
