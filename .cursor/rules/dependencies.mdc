This is a flutter monorepo.

### Monorepo

- This repo uses melos@7 for managing the api docs: https://github.com/invertase/melos/tree/main/docs/
- All dev dependencies should be added to the root `pubspsec.yaml`. They can then be used throughout the codebase after addition.
- The backend code is written with serverpod and the frontend projects are built with flutter. 

### ⛔️ MUST READ

- NEVER upgrade OR downgrade dependencies within the yaml file.
- NEVER add dev dependencies to the individual package `pubspec.yaml` files. Only add them to the root `pubspec.yaml`.  
- NEVER add the `flutter_lints` dependency back to the file. 
- If a dependency is to be added always check that it is the latest version of the application and make sure it exactly matches the versions used throughout the codebase.
- CHANGING VERSIONS rarely solves the bug. STOP suggesting this please. 


### Package / App `pubspec.yaml`

These should have the following

```yaml
version: 0.1.0
environment:
  sdk: ^3.7.2
  flutter: ">=1.17.0"
```
