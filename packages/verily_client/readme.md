# Verily Client (`packages/verily_client`)

This package contains the auto-generated Dart client library for interacting with the Verily Serverpod backend. It is generated by Serverpod based on the protocol definitions (`*.spy.yaml` files) in the `packages/verily_server` project.

## Usage

Flutter applications (like `apps/verily` and `apps/verily_create`) depend on this package to make type-safe calls to the backend API.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** This package is automatically generated. Ensure you have completed the main setup steps in the [root README.md](../../README.md).
2.  **Generation:** This code is generated when you run `serverpod generate` in the `packages/verily_server` directory. You typically **do not** need to modify the code in this package directly.
3.  **Updating:** If backend models or endpoints change in `packages/verily_server`, running `serverpod generate` there will automatically update this client package.
4.  **Dependencies:** Client apps (`apps/verily`, `apps/verily_create`) list this package in their `pubspec.yaml` dependencies. Running `melos bootstrap` from the root links these dependencies locally.
