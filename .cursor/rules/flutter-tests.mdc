Testing guidelines for Flutter projects, covering unit, widget, and integration tests.

- Write unit tests for business logic.
- Implement widget tests for UI components.
- Use integration tests for feature testing.
- Implement proper mocking strategies.
- Use proper test coverage tools.
- Follow proper test naming conventions.
- Implement proper CI/CD testing.

After making changes to each test run `flutter test` from the package or app directory. If tests fail unintentionally keep iterating until the tests pass meaningfully.
